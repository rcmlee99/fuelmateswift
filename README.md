# Fuelmate Swift App

This is a rewritten, lighter and open source version of NSW Fuel Check Mobile App in SwiftUI + Combine. 

I am the original Tech Lead IOS Developer for the previous mobile app which was developed in Objective-C and then later migrated to Swift. 

During my free time, I like to challenged myself to write apps in new framework and libraries. 

Apple new Combine Framework is a declarative Swift API for processing values over time. 
Combine allow us to chain events and simplify code for dealing with things like delegates, notifications, timers, completion blocks and callbacks.
SwiftUI is a modern way to declare user interfaces for any Apple platform.

The new app IOS deployment target is version 13.

SwiftUI IOS 13 does not come with a build in MapView and ActivityIndicatorView.
To use MapKit and UIActivityIndicatorView in SwiftUI, I wrap with the UIViewRepresentable protocol.
